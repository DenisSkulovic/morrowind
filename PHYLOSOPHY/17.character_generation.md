# Character Generation Process

## Overview

The **Character Generation Process** defines a method for creating dynamic characters in a campaign world. Characters are generated using **background blueprints**, optional **customizations**, and associated probabilities to define their traits, items, relationships, and other properties. This ensures each character is unique while maintaining a coherent link to the world and campaign data.

## Key Concepts

### Data Sources
1. **World Database**:
   - Contains editable content, including blueprints for backgrounds, items, and tags. Instances for characters, locations, items, etc. Instances are created in the World database so that every time a Campaign starts, these will be present at the start as initial content.
   - Blueprints and instances can be modified during world-building.

2. **Campaign Database**:
   - Blueprints are immutable during the campaign.
   - Contains both blueprints and dynamically generated content (e.g., instances of items, characters).
   - Instances are created, modified and deleted during gameplay, based on blueprints.

## Background Blueprints

Background blueprints serve as templates for generating characters. Each blueprint contains probabilistic data that defines:
- **Factions**: Determines the character's affiliations.
- **Diseases/Addictions**: Simulates real-life challenges.
- **Professions**: Specifies roles (e.g., farmer, guard).
- **Race/Religion**: Adds diversity to characters.
- **Personality**: Uses profiles for behavioral patterns.
- **Items**: Specifies item sets associated with the background.
- **Past Experiences**: Defines their history and influences.

## Character Generation Instruction

A character generation instruction specifies how to create an individual character:
- References a **background blueprint**.
- Allows **customizations** (e.g., overriding probabilities or item sets).
- Specifies **name** and **location**.

### Instruction Structure

```json
{
    "first_name": "Jack",
    "last_name": "Nicholson",
    "location": "Seyda Neen",
    "background": "BACKGROUND_HIGHLAND_TOWN_GUARD",
    "background_customization": {
        "replace": {
            "personality_probabilities": {
                "PROFILE_CHALLENGER": 1
            },
            "item_sets": [
                "NAKED"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Fetch Background Blueprint
- The blueprint is retrieved from the **world database** using its ID.

### Step 2: Apply Customizations
- `replace`: Overrides existing properties.
- `add`: Adds to existing properties.

### Step 3: Generate Attributes
1. **Tags**:
   - Probabilistically select faction, religion, and personality tags. These do not require separate instances and are best managed as tags.
   - Tags are managed as a `ManyToMany` relation. Tags interconnect various entities, so that this could be later used for memory references and lookup, dialogue mentions, etc.
2. **Items**:
   - Generate items using item sets.
   - Uses `ItemInstanceService` for batch generation.
3. **Instances**:
   - Other entities (e.g., diseases, addictions) are created as required. These created as instances may be useful to track disease and addiction progress.

### Step 4: Save to World/Campaign Database
- The character is saved as an entity in either the **world** or **campaign** database.
- References to immutable blueprints are preserved.

## Notes
1. **Scalability**:
   - Processes batches to avoid overwhelming the system during campaign creation.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Supports detailed customization via `add` and `replace`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Reuses tags and relationships where possible.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Maintains immutable blueprints in the campaign database.
