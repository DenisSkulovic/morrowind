### **Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 Concept**

---

#### **Overview**

This document outlines the architecture and flow for managing three distinct layers of data in the system: 
1. **Layer 1**: A framework of generic blueprints stored as JSON configurations, providing reusable mechanics for any world.
2. **Layer 2**: Custom world-specific blueprints stored in a world database, tailored for individual worlds.
3. **Layer 3**: Campaign-specific instances, dynamically generated based on world blueprints and stored in a campaign database.

The system allows users to create, customize, and interact with worlds and campaigns dynamically.

---

### **1. Layers Overview**

#### **1.1 Layer 1: Generic Blueprints**
- **Purpose**: Provides universal blueprints for entities such as items, characters, traits, and mechanics.
- **Storage**: JSON files in the configuration directory.
- **Examples**:
  - Generic short sword blueprint: `"SHORT_SWORD": { "damage": "1d6", "weight": 2, "type": "melee" }`
  - Generic NPC trait blueprint: `"COWARDLY": { "effect": "-5 combat morale", "description": "Easily frightened in dangerous situations." }`

#### **1.2 Layer 2: World-Specific Blueprints**
- **Purpose**: Stores blueprints and static content specific to a particular world (e.g., Iron Short Sword, Seyda Neen NPCs).
- **Storage**: World database.
- **Examples**:
  - World-specific blueprint for Iron Short Sword, derived from Layer 1.

#### **1.3 Layer 3: Campaign-Specific Instances**
- **Purpose**: Dynamically stores content based on world blueprints. Includes individual instances, events, and NPCs created or modified during gameplay.
- **Storage**: Campaign database.
- **Examples**:
  - Instance of an Iron Short Sword in pristine condition assigned to a specific NPC.
  - Individual NPCs generated with unique IDs and inventory.

### **2. Flow Overview**

The flow involves three stages:
1. **World Creation**: Layer 1 blueprints are copied to the **world database**, and the user adds custom blueprints.
2. **World Editing**: The user customizes the world with additional blueprints and static content.
3. **Campaign Creation**: The world database is used to generate a campaign, populating the **campaign database** with dynamic instances.

---

### **3. World Creation**

#### **Step 1: Loading Layer 1 Blueprints**
- When the user creates a new world:
  - Layer 1 JSON files are loaded.
  - Blueprints are copied into the **world database**.
- **Example**:
  - **Input JSON**:
    ```json
    {
      "SHORT_SWORD": {
        "damage": "1d6",
        "weight": 2,
        "type": "melee",
        "tags": ["generic", "weapon"]
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Stored in World Database**:
    | **ID**         | **Name**     | **Damage** | **Weight** | **Type** | **Tags**        |
    |----------------|--------------|------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
    | `SHORT_SWORD` | Short Sword  | `1d6`      | `2`        | `melee`  | `generic, weapon` |

---

#### **Step 2: Adding Custom Blueprints**
- Users expand the world by adding custom blueprints derived from the generic ones.
- **Example**:
  - User creates an **Iron Short Sword** blueprint:
    - **Derived From**: `SHORT_SWORD`
    - **Custom Data**:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "Iron Short Sword",
        "material": "iron",
        "value": 10,
        "tags": ["iron", "short_sword"]
      }
      ```
    - **Stored in World Database**:
      | **ID**                  | **Name**            | **Material** | **Damage** | **Weight** | **Value** | **Type** | **Tags**                |
      |-------------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
      | `IRON_SHORT_SWORD`      | Iron Short Sword    | Iron         | `1d6`      | `2`        | `10`      | Melee    | `iron, short_sword`     |

---

### **4. Campaign Creation**

#### **Step 1: Using World Blueprints**
- When the user creates a campaign:
  - All blueprints from the **world database** are loaded.
  - Instances are generated dynamically from these blueprints.
- **Example**:
  - From the **Iron Short Sword** blueprint:
    - **Instance 1**:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "ITEM_001",
        "blueprint": "IRON_SHORT_SWORD",
        "condition": "pristine",
        "owner": "NPC_001"
      }
      ```
    - **Instance 2**:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "ITEM_002",
        "blueprint": "IRON_SHORT_SWORD",
        "condition": "used",
        "owner": "NPC_002"
      }
      ```

#### **Step 2: Generating NPCs and Content**
- NPCs, locations, and items are instantiated using world blueprints.
- **Example**:
  - NPC Template in World Database:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "GUARD_TEMPLATE",
      "name": "Imperial Guard",
      "tags": ["npc", "guard"],
      "inventory": ["IRON_SHORT_SWORD"]
    }
    ```
  - Campaign NPC Instances:
    | **ID**         | **Name**          | **Inventory**             | **Location**   |
    |----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
    | `NPC_001`      | Guard in Seyda Neen | `ITEM_001`                | Seyda Neen     |
    | `NPC_002`      | Guard in Balmora  | `ITEM_002`                | Balmora        |

### **5. Example Flow**

#### **World Creation**:
1. User clicks **Create New World**.
2. Layer 1 blueprints are copied to the world database.
3. User adds custom blueprints:
   - Derived `IRON_SHORT_SWORD` from `SHORT_SWORD`.
   - Created `SEYDA_NEEN_TEMPLATE` for guards and items.

#### **World Editing**:
1. User adds lore and NPCs specific to the world.
   - Seyda Neen population, quests, and locations.
   - Tags `dunmeri`, `kwama`, and `almsivi` added to relevant content.

#### **Campaign Creation**:
1. User clicks **Create New Campaign**.
2. The campaign database is populated with:
   - NPCs, e.g., Seyda Neen Guards.
   - Items, e.g., individual instances of Iron Short Swords.
3. Dynamic content begins:
   - New events are generated.
   - New items and NPCs are added to the campaign over time.

### **6. Advantages**

1. **Reusability**:
   - Layer 1 blueprints can be shared across multiple worlds and genres.
2. **Customizability**:
   - Layer 2 allows for detailed world-building specific to user preferences.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Layer 3 starts with blueprint-derived content but evolves dynamically, ensuring replayability.
4. **Modularity**:
   - Separation of layers makes it easy to manage and expand content.
