### **NPC Relations System**

---

#### **Overview**

The **NPC Relations System** introduces a dynamic way to define and manage relationships between NPCs. These relationships influence interactions, attitudes, and gameplay mechanics, providing depth and realism to the world. Relationships are **non-mutual by default**, allowing for asymmetrical perceptions (e.g., one NPC considers the other a friend, while the other considers them only an acquaintance).

This system supports various relationship types, defined by a `RelationEnum`, with customizable effects on attitude computation and potential for specific mechanics.

---

### **1. Structure of Relations**

#### **Relation Types**
Relationships are categorized using the `RelationEnum`:

```typescript
export enum RelationEnum {
    SPOUSE = "spouse",
    SIBLING = "sibling",
    COUSIN = "cousin",
    PARENT = "parent",
    GRANDPARENT = "grandparent",
    DISTANT_RELATIVE = "distant_relative",
    ACQUAINTANCE = "acquaintance",
    FRIEND = "friend",
    BEST_FRIEND = "best_friend",
    RIVAL = "rival",
    PARTNER = "partner",
    NEIGHBOR = "neighbor",
}
```

#### **Attitude Modifiers**
Each relationship type can influence the **attitude** between two NPCs. The modifier is a numeric value added to the overall attitude score. For example:
- **Friend**: +20
- **Rival**: -15
- **Acquaintance**: +5

#### **Asymmetrical Relationships**
Relationships are stored independently for each NPC, allowing asymmetry:
- NPC A → NPC B: **Friend** (+20).
- NPC B → NPC A: **Acquaintance** (+5).

---

### **2. Key Mechanics**

#### **Attitude Computation**
Attitude is computed as a sum of:
1. **Base Attitude**: Neutral default value (e.g., 0).
2. **Relationship Modifiers**: Adjustments based on the relationship type.
3. **Additional Factors**:
   - Shared traits (e.g., both NPCs are Loyalists → +10).
   - Past interactions (e.g., helped in a quest → +30).

**Example Calculation**:
- NPC A → NPC B:
  - Base Attitude: 0.
  - Relationship: **Friend** (+20).
  - Shared Trait: Loyalist (+10).
  - Past Interaction: Helped NPC B in a quest (+30).
  - **Total Attitude**: +60.

#### **Actions and Effects**
Relationships can enable or modify specific mechanics:
1. **Friendship**:
   - Friends may share items or provide help during combat.
2. **Rivalry**:
   - Rivals may sabotage actions or refuse cooperation.
3. **Family Ties**:
   - Family members may protect each other or share memories.
4. **Partnership**:
   - Partners may collaborate on tasks or share resources.

### **3. Relationships Storage in Postgres**

Using a **many-to-many** table in Postgres, relationships are stored as links between two NPCs and their relation type. The effects (modifiers) are defined separately in a **relations definition table** to ensure flexibility and consistency.

#### **Database Schema**

**Relations Definition Table**:
Defines relationship types and their effects.

| **Column**  | **Type**   | **Description**                     |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `relation`  | `varchar`  | Type of relationship (e.g., `FRIEND`, `RIVAL`). |
| `modifier`  | `integer`  | Attitude effect (e.g., +20, -15).   |

**NPC Relationships Table**:
Links two NPCs with a specific relationship type.

| **Column**  | **Type**   | **Description**                     |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `id`        | `uuid`     | Unique identifier for the relationship. |
| `npc1_id`   | `uuid`     | ID of the first NPC.                |
| `npc2_id`   | `uuid`     | ID of the second NPC.               |
| `relation`  | `varchar`  | Relation type (references `relation`). |

#### **Example Data**

**Relations Definition Table**:
| `relation`   | `modifier` |
|--------------|------------|
| `FRIEND`     | `20`       |
| `RIVAL`      | `-15`      |
| `ACQUAINTANCE` | `5`      |

**NPC Relationships Table**:
| `id`         | `npc1_id`  | `npc2_id`  | `relation`  |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| `rel_001`    | `npc_001`  | `npc_002`  | `FRIEND`    |
| `rel_002`    | `npc_002`  | `npc_001`  | `ACQUAINTANCE` |
| `rel_003`    | `npc_001`  | `npc_003`  | `RIVAL`     |

This design keeps relationship effects consistent and enables scalable many-to-many relationships.

### **4. Conceptual Workflow**

1. **Define Relationships**:
   - Assign relationships during NPC generation or through gameplay events.
   - Example: NPC A considers NPC B a **Friend** (+20) and NPC C a **Rival** (-15).

2. **Compute Attitude**:
   - Fetch relationships and calculate attitude for each NPC pair.
   - Adjust dynamically based on shared traits, past actions, or changes in relationships.

3. **Trigger Specific Mechanics**:
   - Use relationships to unlock specific behaviors:
     - Friends share items.
     - Rivals spread rumors.
     - Family members intervene during combat.

---

### **5. Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Friends Sharing Resources**
- NPC A considers NPC B a **Friend** (+20).
- If NPC B is injured, NPC A offers a healing potion.

#### **Scenario 2: Rival Sabotage**
- NPC A considers NPC B a **Rival** (-15).
- During a quest, NPC A misleads NPC B to delay their progress.

#### **Scenario 3: Family Protection**
- NPC A is NPC B’s **Sibling** (+25).
- During combat, NPC A takes a hit intended for NPC B.

---

### **6. Expanding the System**

1. **Dynamic Relationship Changes**:
   - Relationships evolve based on actions and interactions.
   - Example: Completing a quest for a Rival reduces their negative modifier.

2. **Multiple Relationship Types**:
   - An NPC can hold multiple relationships with another NPC.
   - Example:
     - NPC A → NPC B: **Sibling** (+25) and **Rival** (-10).
     - Net Modifier: +15.

3. **Inheritance and Family Trees**:
   - Generate relationships dynamically for extended family networks.
   - Example:
     - Parent → Child: **Parent** (+30).
     - Grandparent → Grandchild: **Grandparent** (+20).
