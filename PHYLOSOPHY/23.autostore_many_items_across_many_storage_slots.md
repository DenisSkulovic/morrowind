### **Mechanics Proposal**

#### **Key Principles**
1. **Prioritize Items**:
   - Sort items by size and weight:
     - Larger items are placed first to minimize fragmentation of the grid.
     - Heavier items are prioritized for slots with higher weight limits.
   - Items should be placed into the most restrictive slots first (e.g., small pockets).

2. **Prioritize Slots**:
   - Sort storage slots by:
     - **Weight Limit**: Use slots with lower weight limits for smaller/lighter items to reserve larger slots for heavy items.
     - **Grid Size**: Use smaller slots first, keeping larger slots for bigger items.

3. **Iterative Placement**:
   - Place items iteratively, trying smaller slots first.
   - If an item cannot fit in any slot, the process stops for that item, and an exception can be raised or the item marked as "unplaced."

4. **Auto-Organize Slots**:
   - After placing an item in a slot, auto-organize that slot to optimize grid space before moving to the next item.

### **Placement Logic**

1. **Sort Items and Slots**:
   - Sort items by `size (width * height)` descending and then by `weight` descending.
   - Sort storage slots by:
     - Available grid space (width * height) ascending.
     - Remaining weight capacity ascending.

2. **Assign Items to Slots**:
   - Loop through each item and attempt to place it into the smallest suitable storage slot.
   - For each storage slot:
     - Check if the item fits in terms of grid size and weight.
     - If it fits, place the item and move to the next item.

3. **Handle Failed Placements**:
   - If an item cannot fit into any slot:
     - Mark the item as "unplaced" and return it to the user for manual handling.
     - Alternatively, notify the user of insufficient storage space.

4. **Optimization**:
   - After all items are placed, auto-organize all storage slots to optimize space usage.

### **Proposed Algorithm**

```typescript
class StorageSlotService {

    public static placeItemsIntoSlots(
        storageSlots: StorageSlot[],
        items: Item[]
    ): { placedItems: Item[]; unplacedItems: Item[] } {
        // Sort items by size (largest first), then by weight
        items.sort((a, b) => 
            (b.size!.width * b.size!.height) - (a.size!.width * a.size!.height) || 
            b.weight - a.weight
        );

        // Sort slots by available space and weight limit (smallest first)
        storageSlots.sort((a, b) => 
            (a.grid!.width * a.grid!.height) - (b.grid!.width * b.grid!.height) || 
            (a.maxWeight! - a.storedItems!.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.weight, 0))
        );

        const placedItems: Item[] = [];
        const unplacedItems: Item[] = [];

        items.forEach(item => {
            let itemPlaced = false;

            // Try to place the item in each slot
            for (const slot of storageSlots) {
                // Auto-organize the slot before placement
                StorageSlotService.organizeSlot(slot);

                const grid = slot.grid!;
                const weight = {
                    stored: slot.storedItems!.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.weight, 0),
                    max: slot.maxWeight!,
                };

                // Try to place the item in the slot
                if (StorageSlotService.autoPlaceItem(grid, item, weight)) {
                    slot.storedItems!.push(item); // Add the item to the slot's stored items
                    itemPlaced = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (itemPlaced) {
                placedItems.push(item);
            } else {
                unplacedItems.push(item); // If no slot is found, add to unplaced items
            }
        });

        // Auto-organize all slots after placement
        storageSlots.forEach(slot => StorageSlotService.organizeSlot(slot));

        return { placedItems, unplacedItems };
    }

    public static organizeSlot(slot: StorageSlot): void {
        const grid = slot.grid!;
        const items = slot.storedItems!;
        StorageSlotService.organizeGrid(grid, items);
    }

    public static autoPlaceItem(grid: StorageGrid, item: Item, weight?: WeightObj): boolean {
        for (let x = 0; x < grid.length; x++) {
            for (let y = 0; y < grid[0].length; y++) {
                if (StorageSlotService.canPlaceItem(grid, item, { x, y }, weight)) {
                    StorageSlotService.placeItem(grid, item, { x, y });
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### **Behavior with Equipment Slots**
1. Equip necessary items (e.g., pants, backpack) to the character first.
2. Refresh the list of available storage slots after equipping these items.
3. Proceed to distribute remaining items into the available storage slots.

---

### **Usage Example**

#### **Scenario**:
- A character is generated with:
  - Equipment slots for pants and a backpack.
  - Items: 
    - `Short Sword` (1x3, 5kg)
    - `Potion` (1x1, 0.5kg)
    - `Helmet` (2x2, 2kg)
    - `Gold Bar` (3x2, 10kg)

#### **Steps**:
1. Equip pants and backpack to create storage slots (`Left Pocket`, `Right Pocket`, and `Main Section`).
2. Call `placeItemsIntoSlots()` with all available storage slots and the item array.
3. Items are sorted and distributed:
   - Small items (e.g., `Potion`) are placed into pockets.
   - Larger/heavier items (e.g., `Gold Bar`) are placed into the `Main Section` of the backpack.

#### **Result**:
- Efficient usage of all storage slots with remaining items either placed or returned for manual handling.
