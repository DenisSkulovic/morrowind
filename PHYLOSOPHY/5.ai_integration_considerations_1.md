### **AI Integration for Game Management**

---

#### **Overview**
This document outlines the agreed approach for integrating AI into the game to manage decisions, narration, and other aspects of game progression. The AI will be utilized in two key areas: **decision-making** and **narration**.

---

### **AI Responsibilities**

1. **Decision-Making**:
   - The AI evaluates game data (provided as JSON) and determines the next action or decision for NPCs, characters, or world events.
   - Input:
     - JSON containing traits, items, stats, context, and current game state.
   - Output:
     - JSON with the AI’s decision, including proposed actions and their reasoning.
   - Example Workflow:
     1. Input: 
        ```json
        {
          "npc": { "name": "Fargoth", "traits": ["Cowardly", "Greedy"], "hp": 20 },
          "player": { "name": "Caius", "traits": ["Aggressive"], "hp": 50 },
          "context": { "location": "Balmora", "current_event": "Combat" }
        }
        ```
     2. AI Decision:
        ```json
        {
          "action": "use_item",
          "target": "self",
          "item": "healing_potion",
          "reason": "Low HP and cowardly trait encourages self-preservation."
        }
        ```

2. **Narration**:
   - After processing the AI's decision and applying game mechanics (e.g., dice rolls), the backend sends the updated state back to the AI for narration.
   - Input:
     - Updated JSON state reflecting the results of the action.
   - Output:
     - Natural language description for the UI.
   - Example Workflow:
     1. Input:
        ```json
        {
          "npc": { "name": "Fargoth", "hp": 40, "status": "Healing" },
          "player": { "name": "Caius", "hp": 50 },
          "event": "Combat Round",
          "action": "Fargoth uses a healing potion to restore HP."
        }
        ```
     2. AI Narration:
        ```plaintext
        "Fargoth quickly drinks a healing potion, restoring his strength. He seems ready to make a run for it."
        ```

---

### **Workflow**

1. **Decision-Making Phase**:
   - Backend sends game state to the AI for action proposals.
   - AI returns decisions in structured JSON.
   - Backend applies the decision, game mechanics, and rules (e.g., dice rolls).
   - Example Decision:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "flee",
       "reason": "Cowardly trait and low HP."
     }
     ```

2. **Narration Phase**:
   - Backend sends the updated state (post-action) to the AI.
   - AI generates a natural-language description to narrate outcomes.
   - Example Narration:
     ```plaintext
     "Fargoth turns and sprints away, clutching his side. The cowardly Dunmer wants no part of this fight."
     ```

---

### **Backend Responsibilities**

1. **Control and Fairness**:
   - Apply game mechanics like dice rolls, random number generation, and pre-defined rules.
   - Ensure outcomes align with game logic and constraints.

2. **State Management**:
   - Maintain and update the game state (e.g., traits, stats, world changes).
   - Save key outcomes for future interactions (e.g., adding traits like `Injured`, `Maimed`).

3. **Prompt Construction**:
   - Dynamically generate structured JSON prompts for AI decision-making and narration.
   - Ensure prompts provide enough context for the AI to make coherent decisions or narrate effectively.

---

### **Key Benefits**

- **Modular Design**:
  - AI focuses on logic and creativity (decision-making, narration).
  - Backend enforces rules and game balance.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Scales to multiple systems: combat, quests, dialogue, and world state management.
- **Control**:
  - You define the boundaries and randomness, ensuring the AI doesn’t override core mechanics.

---

### **Example Prompts**

#### Decision-Making
```plaintext
You are Fargoth, a cowardly and greedy NPC in the town of Balmora. You are fighting Caius, an aggressive player with a sword. You have 20 HP and a healing potion. Caius has 50 HP. Decide your next action based on your traits and context. 
Output the decision in JSON format.
```

#### Narration
```plaintext
The player, Caius, attacked Fargoth with a sword, dealing 12 damage. Fargoth used a healing potion to restore 20 HP. Narrate the combat round in a descriptive style for the game's UI.
```

### **Implementation Notes**

- **Decision-Making API**:
  - Use an AI service like OpenAI or HuggingFace to process structured JSON prompts.
  - Example call:
    ```typescript
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
        model: "text-davinci-003",
        prompt: decisionPrompt,
        max_tokens: 150
    });
    ```

- **Narration API**:
  - Similar setup with a narration-specific prompt and output format.

- **Integration**:
  - Decision-making and narration are separate API calls with distinct workflows.
  - Backend orchestrates transitions between the two.

### **Conclusion**
This approach leverages AI for decision-making and narration in a modular, scalable way. By combining structured inputs, backend rule enforcement, and AI-generated creativity, the system remains balanced and flexible for future game expansions.
