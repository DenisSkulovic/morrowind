### **Backgrounds and Customization for Procedural Character Generation**

---

#### **Overview**

Backgrounds serve as the **entry point** for procedural character generation, providing a structured approach to define a character’s core identity, including personality, items, skills, and memories. Additional **customizations**, such as location-specific knowledge or faction affiliation, refine the generated character to suit the game context.

This system operates in two layers:
1. **Layer 1: Generic Functionality**:
   - Provides the foundational structure and process for defining backgrounds and connecting them to personality profiles, item pools, skill pools, and memories.
2. **Layer 2: World Content Creation**:
   - Implements specific backgrounds (e.g., "Imperial Guard", "Bandit") and customizations (e.g., "Lives in Seyda Neen", "Member of the Imperial Legion").

---

### **1. Layer 1: Generic Functionality**

#### **Backgrounds**

A **background** is a high-level label that defines:
1. **Personality Probabilities**:
   - Specifies the likelihood of assigning each personality profile (e.g., Loyalist, Reformer).
2. **Item Pools**:
   - Connects to predefined item pools that represent potential inventory.
3. **Skill Pools**:
   - Links to skill pools for generating abilities relevant to the background.

**Conceptual Example**:
- Background: "Imperial Guard"
  - Personality Probabilities:
    - 50% Loyalist, 40% Reformer, 10% Challenger.
  - Item Pools:
    - Weapons: "Imperial Guard Weapons".
    - Armor: "Imperial Guard Armor".
  - Skill Pools:
    - Combat: "Swordsmanship, Shield Block".
    - Discipline: "Leadership, Marching".

---

#### **Customizations**

Customizations refine characters generated from a background by:
1. **Adding Contextual Data**:
   - Location: `"Seyda Neen"` adds local knowledge.
   - Faction: `"Imperial Legion"` modifies loyalty or alignment.
2. **Injecting Specific Traits**:
   - Example: `"Vigilant"` for guards stationed in dangerous areas.
3. **Memory Pool Adjustments**:
   - Add memories relevant to the character’s setting or role.

**Conceptual Example**:
- Customization: `"Lives in Seyda Neen"`
  - Adds Memories:
    - `"Knows Seyda Neen's geography"`.
    - `"Recognizes local traders"`.
  - Adds Traits:
    - `"Watchful"` for familiarity with local happenings.

#### **Character Generation Steps**

1. **Select Background**:
   - Start with a predefined background (e.g., "Bandit").
2. **Roll for Personality**:
   - Use probabilities to assign a personality profile.
3. **Generate Items and Skills**:
   - Select items and skills from connected pools.
4. **Apply Customizations**:
   - Refine the character based on location, faction, or specific traits.
5. **Generate Final Character**:
   - Combine all aspects (traits, items, skills, memories) into a cohesive character.

### **2. Layer 2: World Content Creation**

#### **Background Definitions**

Specific backgrounds are defined during world creation, linking them to relevant probabilities and pools.

**Example Background: Imperial Guard**
```json
{
    "id": "background_imperial_guard",
    "name": "Imperial Guard",
    "personality_probabilities": [
        { "profile_id": "profile_reformer", "probability": 0.4 },
        { "profile_id": "profile_loyalist", "probability": 0.5 },
        { "profile_id": "profile_challenger", "probability": 0.1 }
    ],
    "item_pools": ["pool_imperial_weapons", "pool_imperial_armor"],
    "skill_pools": ["pool_combat_skills", "pool_legion_skills"]
}
```

**Example Background: Bandit**
```json
{
    "id": "background_bandit",
    "name": "Bandit",
    "personality_probabilities": [
        { "profile_id": "profile_challenger", "probability": 0.6 },
        { "profile_id": "profile_loyalist", "probability": 0.2 },
        { "profile_id": "profile_reformer", "probability": 0.1 }
    ],
    "item_pools": ["pool_bandit_weapons", "pool_bandit_loot"],
    "skill_pools": ["pool_combat_skills", "pool_survival_skills"]
}
```

---

#### **Customization Examples**

Customizations modify generated characters based on additional context.

**Example: Lives in Seyda Neen**
- Adds:
  - Memories: `"Knows Seyda Neen geography"`, `"Recognizes local traders"`.
  - Traits: `"Watchful"`.

**Example: Member of the Imperial Legion**
- Adds:
  - Faction: `"Imperial Legion"`.
  - Traits: `"Loyal"`, `"Disciplined"`.

### **3. Expanded Workflow for Character Generation**

#### Input:
- Background: `"Imperial Guard"`.
- Customizations: `"Lives in Seyda Neen"`, `"Member of Imperial Legion"`.

#### Workflow:
1. **Select Background**:
   - Start with `"Imperial Guard"`.
2. **Roll for Personality**:
   - 50% Loyalist, 40% Reformer, 10% Challenger.
   - Result: `"Loyalist"`.
3. **Generate Items**:
   - Pull from `"pool_imperial_weapons"`:
     - `"Imperial Sword"`.
   - Pull from `"pool_imperial_armor"`:
     - `"Imperial Helmet"`, `"Imperial Chestplate"`.
4. **Generate Skills**:
   - Pull from `"pool_combat_skills"`:
     - `"Swordsmanship"`, `"Shield Block"`.
   - Pull from `"pool_legion_skills"`:
     - `"Discipline"`.
5. **Apply Customizations**:
   - Location: `"Lives in Seyda Neen"` adds memories:
     - `"Knows Seyda Neen geography"`, `"Recognizes local traders"`.
   - Faction: `"Member of Imperial Legion"` adds traits:
     - `"Disciplined"`, `"Loyal"`.
6. **Final Character**:
   - Combines traits, items, skills, memories, and location.

#### Output:
```json
{
    "npc": {
        "name": "Feldrin",
        "role": "Imperial Guard",
        "location": "Seyda Neen",
        "faction": "Imperial Legion",
        "personality": {
            "profile": "The Loyalist",
            "traits": ["responsible", "anxious", "risk-averse", "disciplined", "loyal"]
        },
        "items": ["Imperial Sword", "Imperial Helmet", "Imperial Chestplate"],
        "skills": ["Swordsmanship", "Shield Block", "Discipline"],
        "memories": ["Knows Seyda Neen geography", "Recognizes local traders"]
    }
}
```

### **4. Advantages of the Background System**

1. **Centralized Entry Point**:
   - Backgrounds act as a foundation for character generation, making the system intuitive.

2. **Flexible Customization**:
   - Add layers like location-specific knowledge or factional traits without disrupting core functionality.

3. **Scalable Content Creation**:
   - New backgrounds and customizations can be easily added during world-building.

4. **Balanced Randomness**:
   - Controlled probabilities ensure diversity while maintaining thematic coherence.
