# Character Tag System for Emotional and Conversational Dynamics

## **Overview**
The Character Tag System introduces a way to represent a character's preferences, fears, curiosities, and needs through an array of tags. Tags serve as associative elements that influence dialogue, behavior, and decision-making in characters. Inspired by games like *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*, this system integrates conversational depth and emotional response mechanisms that enhance immersion and realism.

Tags are dynamic, allowing characters to adapt their responses and behaviors based on context, external events, or personal needs. This document explores how tags are assigned, used, and influence character interactions.

## **Core Concepts**

### **1. Tag Types**
Characters can have multiple arrays of tags, categorized based on their emotional and practical significance:
- **Likes**: Tags representing topics, objects, or entities the character enjoys or admires.
  - Example: A scholar might have "Astrology" or "Ancient Runes."
- **Dislikes**: Tags for things the character detests or fears.
  - Example: A xenophobic character might have "Elvish" or "Foreigners."
- **Curiosities**: Tags for things that intrigue or interest the character.
  - Example: A trader might have "Rare Gems" or "Exotic Spices."
- **Irritations**: Tags for things that annoy or disturb the character.
  - Example: A nobleman might have "Dirty Clothes" or "Crowded Spaces."
- **Important Needs**: Tags representing immediate priorities or quests.
  - Example: A starving character might have "Nearest Food Source."
- **Associations**: Tags connected to memories, relationships, or past events.
  - Example: A veteran might associate "Battle of Red Mountain" with "Honor" or "Loss."

### **2. Dynamic Tag Assignment**
Tags can be dynamically assigned based on:
- **Quests**: Characters involved in a quest may receive relevant tags.
  - Example: During a quest to find a town, a character might receive the tag "Directions."
- **Needs**: Tags reflect the character's immediate goals or problems.
  - Example: A thirsty character might have "Water" in their important array.
- **Dialogue Topics**: Topics discussed can dynamically add or highlight tags.
  - Example: Talking about "Elvish Cuisine" may add "Curious about Elvish Culture" to a character’s curiosities.

### **3. Dialogue and Association**
The system uses tags to create associative, dynamic conversations:
1. **Tag Referencing in Dialogue**:
   - When an NPC responds, their dialogue references specific tags, influencing the conversation's tone and content.
   - Example: A farmer with "Weather" in likes might comment on the sunny day, steering the conversation towards weather-related topics.

2. **Associations for Topic Steering**:
   - Dialogue is steered by selecting associations from the character’s or NPC’s tag arrays.
   - Example:
     - NPC mentions "Thalmor" (a dislike for the player).
     - Player responds with a related association like "Oppression" to steer the conversation towards rebellion.

3. **Exhausting Topics**:
   - Topics naturally exhaust when no further associations are available.
   - Example:
     - Discussing "Weather" might lead to "Harvest," but once all related tags are explored, the topic is closed.

4. **Sharp Topic Changes**:
   - Players or NPCs can abruptly change topics using unrelated associations.
   - Example: Mid-conversation about "Weather," the player interjects, "By the way, did you hear about the bandits?"

## **Behavioral Responses**
Tags also influence the emotional and behavioral responses of characters:
1. **Emotional Alignment**:
   - If a player's tags align with the NPC’s likes, the NPC becomes friendlier.
   - If a player’s tags align with the NPC’s dislikes, they may become hostile or unfriendly.

2. **Politeness and Deceit**:
   - NPCs can mask their true emotions based on context.
   - Example:
     - An NPC dislikes the "Thalmor" but is polite to a Thalmor officer, showing fake admiration.

3. **Dynamic Hostility**:
   - NPCs dynamically alter behavior based on revealed tags.
   - Example:
     - A xenophobic NPC becomes openly hostile after learning the player supports the "Elvish Faction."

## **Examples**

### **1. Dialogue Steering**
**Scenario**:
- NPC: "The weather has been pleasant, hasn't it?" *(References the "Weather" tag.)*
- Player Associations:
  - "Harvest" (Steers the topic towards farming.)
  - "Travel" (Shifts focus to roads and towns.)
  - "Bandits" (Abruptly changes the topic to danger on the roads.)

### **2. Behavioral Response**
**Scenario**:
- Player expresses admiration for the "Thalmor."
- NPC Tags:
  - **Dislikes**: "Thalmor."
  - **Faction**: "Stormcloaks."
- Result:
  - The NPC masks their hostility and responds cautiously: "Ah, the Thalmor... They have their ways."
  - Internally, the NPC becomes less inclined to assist the player.

## **Implementation**

### **Tag Data Structure**
Tags are stored as key-value pairs with metadata:
```json
{
    "tag": "Astrology",
    "category": "Curiosity",
    "strength": 0.8,  // Value from 0 to 1 indicating the importance
    "context": "Scholar" // Optional context or source
}
```

### **Dialogue Structure**
Dialogue lines include references to tags:
```json
{
    "line": "The stars hold many secrets. Do you believe in destiny?",
    "tags": ["Astrology", "Destiny", "Scholar"]
}
```

### **Dynamic Tag Queries**
During conversations:
1. Query up to 20 associations based on tags in dialogue and character preferences.
2. Use AI to select associations that align with the character’s tags and steer the conversation.

## **Conclusion**
The Character Tag System provides a flexible framework for simulating realistic and engaging interactions. By incorporating dynamic tags, emotional responses, and associative dialogue steering, the game creates a living, breathing world where NPCs and players respond naturally to their environment and each other. This system offers infinite possibilities for storytelling, character development, and player immersion.
