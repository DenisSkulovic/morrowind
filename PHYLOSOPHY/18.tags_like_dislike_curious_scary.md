// TODO create concept documentation that explains how characters can have arrays of tags for something they like, dislike, are curious about, makes them scared, irritates them, etc. For example, a xenophobic character may receive "Elvish" as a tag they dislike. A scholar may receive "Astrology" as a tag they both like and are curious about. This will influence dialogue (i.e. exchange of information and emotion). Tags can be dynamically assigned based on needs or quests. If I have a quest and need to travel to a town, I might have a tag that suggests I needs to find out the location and directions, so this tag would be in important array. If I am starving, I might have a tag for nearest food source in important array. Etc. Something like that. And these tags that interconnect many entities will serve as associatioons for characters to mention in dialogue, and to find associations in own memory when responding. Just like the mind works, you know? Gollum... Gollum...

Imagine how Morrowind did it with blue phrases to continue dialogue. So basically this would take inspiration, but on a deeper level. The response from an NPC will carry tags and associations, so your character(or another NPC if its two NPCs talking) would continue the conversation by selecting a tag or association to steer the discussion in s slightly or drastically different direction. There will be an option to completely change the topic by choosing from unrelated options. Chooseing related options will steer the conversation, and unrelated ones will sharply end the current topic and start a new one. A topic may get exhausted and not present any associations, so a sharp turn may be natural. You discuss the weather, and go "By the way, did you...". 

Ok, so when I receive a response from the NPC, it carries a bunch of referenced tags, in what he said or what he has, maybe what happens around. I will query a limited amount of associations, say 20, and will offer the AI to choose, based on the arrays of likes/dislikes/curious/important/etc. The AI will choose the chosen association, or several associations at the same time to talk about. If my character has Thalmor in dislikes and expressed a dislike in the text, the NPC who likes Thalmor or is in their Faction will become unfriendly or hostile. And of course the NPC can be careful, secretive and deceitful and not show their true feelings or emotions, like in this case when the NPC doesnt like Thalmor but is talking to a Thalmor officer. The NPC will have to be polite and welcoming with the Thalmor officer, despite his dislike of Thalmor. Stuffs like thiiis, ye?
