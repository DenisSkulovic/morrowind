# **World and Campaign Database Design**

## **Overview**
This document defines the concepts and mechanics for managing **World** and **Campaign** databases in the game, reflecting the core vision for dynamic content, isolated progression, and future extensibility. It describes the current **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** goals and outlines potential features for later development.

## **Concepts**

### **World Database**
- **Purpose**: Serves as the repository for user-created content, including locations, factions, NPCs, items, quests, and overall world settings.
- **Editable**: Users can freely modify the content to customize their worlds.
- **Initial State**: The data in the World Database forms the basis for creating new campaigns. It provides the "initial state" of the game world.
- **No Progression**: The World Database is static and does not evolve with any specific campaign. Users can delete, modify, or extend worlds without affecting campaigns derived from them.

### **Campaign Database**
- **Purpose**: Contains the dynamically evolving state of a single campaign, entirely independent of the World Database once created.
- **Derived From World**: When a campaign is created, relevant data is copied from the World Database to the Campaign Database.
- **Dynamic and Isolated**: Campaign data evolves independently of the World Database, simulating real-life progression. World edits do not affect existing campaigns.
- **Immutable Initial State**: Campaigns cannot be re-synchronized with the World Database after creation. Changes to the world must be applied before creating a campaign.

## **Key Features**

### **MVP Goals**
1. **World Editing**: Users can create and modify worlds, including locations, NPCs, items, and questlines.
2. **Campaign Creation**:
   - Copy all relevant data from the World Database to the Campaign Database.
   - Campaigns begin as isolated entities, safe from future changes or deletions in the World Database.
3. **Dynamic Campaigns**:
   - Campaigns simulate life by evolving NPC states, items, and quests dynamically.
   - Auto-generated content (e.g., random NPCs, locations, or events) is created as the player progresses and discarded if deemed unimportant.
4. **Data Decoupling**: Campaigns and Worlds are separate entities, ensuring no interdependency.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Save Files**:
   - Enable snapshots of campaign states for manual saves or autosaves.
   - Allow players to restore campaigns to earlier points.
2. **World Import/Export**:
   - Enable users to export worlds as compressed files (e.g., `.zip`) for sharing.
   - Allow importing worlds to create new campaigns or edit them further.
3. **Worker-Based Task System**:
   - Implement background jobs to handle campaign creation and other resource-intensive tasks efficiently.
   - Improve responsiveness of campaign creation by delegating heavy tasks to workers.

## **Core Mechanics**

### **World to Campaign Workflow**
1. **World Database**:
   - Users create or edit worlds, defining essential locations, NPCs, factions, and quests.
   - Optional: Users may remove unrelated factions, locations, or entities to create smaller worlds.

2. **Campaign Creation**:
   - Upon user request, the system:
     - Copies the entire world data into the Campaign Database.
     - Marks the copied data as independent.
   - Any dynamic content not pre-defined (e.g., procedural NPCs, quests) is generated during gameplay.

3. **Post-Creation Independence**:
   - Campaign data evolves uniquely, reflecting player actions, NPC states, and dynamic events.
   - No changes to the World Database affect an ongoing campaign.

---

### **Dynamic Content Management**
1. **Procedural Generation**:
   - **Locations**: Automatically generate minor or random locations (e.g., forests, small villages) when players approach them.
   - **NPCs and Events**:
     - Generate minor NPCs and events on-the-fly.
     - Remove unimportant entities or events from memory once resolved, unless flagged as important.
   - **Example**: A random bandit encounter in a forest will not persist unless tied to a quest or important storyline.

2. **State Retention**:
   - Locations or NPCs flagged as "important" (e.g., tied to quests) will remain in the Campaign Database.
   - Unimportant entities are discarded to optimize database size and performance.

---

### **Save and Export Features**
1. **Save Files**:
   - Allow manual and autosave functionality for campaigns.
   - Provide the option to load earlier states in case of game-breaking events or player mistakes.

2. **World Export/Import**:
   - Export worlds as JSON files, bundled with metadata for easier sharing.
   - Allow re-importing exported worlds for further editing or new campaign creation.

---

### **Storage Considerations**
1. **Data Duplication**:
   - **Advantages**:
     - Ensures campaign safety and independence from the World Database.
     - Facilitates parallel campaigns derived from the same world.
   - **Risks**:
     - Increased storage usage.
     - Potential failure during campaign creation (e.g., one operation succeeds, and the other fails).
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Implement transactional logic to ensure atomic operations for world-to-campaign copying.
     - Use efficient storage mechanisms to minimize overhead.

2. **Auto-Generated Content**:
   - Unimportant content is removed after resolution to prevent database bloat.
   - Important entities are retained and updated dynamically as the campaign progresses.

---

## **Examples**

### **Campaign Creation Workflow**
1. User edits the world to include key locations (e.g., Vivec, Seyda Neen) and NPCs (e.g., Caius Cosades).
2. User clicks "Create Campaign," and the system:
   - Copies the world into the Campaign Database.
   - Generates dynamic content as the player progresses (e.g., random encounters, auto-generated NPCs).
3. Campaign evolves dynamically, independent of future changes to the World Database.

---

### **Auto-Generated Content Example**
1. Player approaches a forest.
2. System generates:
   - Random NPCs (e.g., hunters, bandits).
   - Local events (e.g., a bandit ambush).
3. Once resolved:
   - If important, the NPC or event is retained (e.g., quest-related bandits).
   - If unimportant, the data is discarded.

## **Conclusion**
This system is designed to balance creative flexibility and dynamic gameplay. The World Database empowers users to craft detailed worlds, while the Campaign Database ensures safe and immersive progression. Future enhancements like save files, export/import, and task management will further refine the experience, aligning with the game's vision of simulating a living, evolving world.
