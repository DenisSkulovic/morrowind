### **1. Pages**

#### **1.1 Dashboard**
- **Purpose**: Provide a centralized overview of all content categories.
- **Sections**:
  - **Category Overview**: Displays a summary of all content types (e.g., number of items, characters).
  - **Recent Activity**: Shows recently created or edited entities.
  - **Search Bar**: Quick navigation to specific entities.
  - **Quick Actions**: Buttons for creating new blueprints or instances.

---

#### **1.2 Entity Lists**
- **Purpose**: List all entities in a category with filtering, sorting, and bulk actions.
- **Pages**:
  - Items
  - Characters
  - Traits
  - Factions
  - Races
  - Skills
  - Generation Instructions (e.g., for characters or groups)
- **Sections**:
  - **Table/Grid View**: Displays entities with sortable columns.
  - **Filters**: By tags, types, or specific attributes.
  - **Bulk Actions**: Delete, duplicate, export.
  - **Search Bar**: For filtering results.

---

#### **1.3 Entity Editing**
- **Purpose**: Edit or create entities in detail.
- **Pages**:
  - Item Editor
  - Character Editor
  - Trait Editor
  - Faction Editor
  - Generation Instruction Editor
- **Sections**:
  - **Dynamic Form**: Main form for editing the entity. Adding simple data like number/string, or connecting a relationship to another entity. The connect button will offer a search input as well as a button to create a new one if it doesn't yet exist, onening a popup or sidebar to create (and of course you could have multiple ones on top of each other. Creating a character you click to create a religion, and creating that religion you click to create a tag entity for that religion, so the creation sidebars can be stacked on top of each other.)
  - **Preview**: If it is a generation instruction, like for character or group of characters, there could be a section to try out this instruction and inspect the generated characters, maybe even talk to them via AI.

---

#### **1.4 Settings**
- **Purpose**: General settings for the platform.
- **Sections**:
  - **Themes**: Customize UI appearance.
  - **Data Import/Export**: Upload or download JSON templates.
  - **Preferences**: User-specific configurations.

---

#### **3.3 Preview Subcomponents**
- **ItemPreview**:
  - Displays an item blueprint or instance.
- **CharacterPreview**:

---

### **4. Patterns for Usability**

#### **4.1 Inline Editing**
- For minor changes (e.g., renaming an entity).
- Avoids navigation to a separate page.

#### **4.2 Modals and Panels**
- Use modals for focused tasks (e.g., adding tags, managing relationships).
- Use sliding side panels for multitasking (e.g., editing related entities while staying on the main page).

#### **4.3 Contextual Previews**
- Show previews for entities while editing related entities (e.g., preview an item while assigning it to a character).

---
