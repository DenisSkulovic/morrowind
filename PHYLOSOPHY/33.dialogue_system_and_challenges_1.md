# Dialogue System Concept: AI-Controlled Character Interaction

## Overview
This document outlines the conceptual design of a dialogue system where an AI model simulates a character's responses during a dynamic conversation with a player. The dialogue system ensures continuity, coherence, and adherence to character traits and world context while addressing challenges such as token limits, maintaining context, and topic management.

---

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Character Interaction**:
   - Player interacts with AI-controlled characters via dialogue.
   - AI responses align with character traits, moods, and the game world context.

2. **Topic-Based Conversations**:
   - Dialogue flows across various topics, dynamically transitioning from one to another.
   - Topics evolve based on player actions, AI responses, and context.

3. **Context Management**:
   - Summarized history and relevant context ensure the AI remains consistent and accurate throughout the dialogue.
   - Recent exchanges are handled separately from older summarized interactions.

---

## Dialogue Flow
### 1. **Dialogue Initialization**
- **Frontend Input**:
  - Player's character ID.
  - AI-controlled character ID.
- **Backend Action**:
  - Retrieve character data from the database (e.g., traits, inventory, moods, known facts).
  - Construct an initial context for the AI:
    - Character profiles.
    - World context (e.g., environment, ongoing events).
    - Dialogue state (if resuming).

---

### 2. **During the Dialogue**
#### Context Handling
- **Immediate History**:
  - Include the last few messages in full for continuity.
- **Summarized History**:
  - Summarize past exchanges by topic to keep the token usage efficient.

#### Managing Transitions
- **Topic-Based Flow**:
  - At the end of each topic:
    - Summarize the discussion.
    - Cache the summary for later use.
  - When starting a new topic:
    - Provide the previous topic's summary and last few exchanges as context.
  - For long topics, summarize periodically.

#### AI Request Structure
- Construct a structured input for the AI:
  ```json
  {
      "requestId": "dialogue-turn-1",
      "prompt": "You are John, a cautious merchant. You are talking to Sarah, an inquisitive adventurer. Sarah is asking about a rare artifact you may have.",
      "metadata": {
          "useCase": "dialogue_generation",
          "context": "topic_summary"
      },
      "options": {
          "model": "gpt-4",
          "temperature": 0.7,
          "maxTokens": 200
      }
  }
  ```

---

### 3. **End of Dialogue**
- Summarize the final topic and store the result.
- Update any changes to character states or relationships (e.g., opinions, traits).

---

## Challenges and Solutions
### 1. **Token Limits**
- **Challenge**: AI models have strict token limits, requiring careful management of context.
- **Solution**:
  - Resend only relevant context, summarizing older interactions.
  - Use dynamic trimming and summarization to prioritize key information.

### 2. **AI Context Retention**
- **Challenge**: AI lacks persistent memory and may lose track of old details.
- **Solution**:
  - Resend necessary context in each request, focusing on:
    - Character profiles.
    - Summarized past topics.
    - Immediate dialogue history.

### 3. **Dialogue Coherence**
- **Challenge**: AI may deviate from character traits or world context.
- **Solution**:
  - Provide character profiles and world context in every request.
  - Validate AI responses for consistency before displaying them.

### 4. **Summarization Complexity**
- **Challenge**: Summarizing past exchanges effectively without losing key details.
- **Solution**:
  - Use separate AI calls for summarization.
  - Summarize by topic and periodically during long discussions.

## Example Backend Implementation
### Summarizing Past Exchanges
```typescript
async function summarizeTopic(topicMessages: string[]): Promise<string> {
    const prompt = `Summarize the following dialogue:\n\n${topicMessages.join("\n")}\n\nSummarize concisely.`;
    const response = await callAiService({
        requestId: "summary-request",
        prompt: prompt,
        options: { model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.5, maxTokens: 200 },
    });
    return response.output;
}
```

### Building Context for AI Requests
```typescript
function buildContextRequest(messages: string[], summaries: string[], profiles: string[]): string {
    const profileText = profiles.join("\n");
    const summariesText = summaries.join("\n");
    const historyText = messages.join("\n");
    return `Profiles:\n${profileText}\n\nSummaries:\n${summariesText}\n\nRecent Exchanges:\n${historyText}`;
}
```
