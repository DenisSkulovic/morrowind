# **Database Management for Production**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines the considerations, strategies, and practices for managing databases in a production environment for this project. The database layer is critical to ensure the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of the platform's backend services. This project relies on PostgreSQL for persistent storage and Redis for caching and transient state management.

## **Database Architecture**

### **Separation of Concerns**
1. **World Database**:
   - Stores static world data, including characters, items, locations, factions, and other world-building entities.
   - Acts as a blueprint for all campaigns.

2. **Campaign Database**:
   - Contains dynamic and mutable data generated during gameplay.
   - Tracks the evolving state of the campaign, including player decisions, NPC actions, and world changes.

3. **Redis**:
   - Used for caching and managing ephemeral state during active gameplay sessions.
   - Provides high-speed access to frequently used or transient data, such as dialogue state and AI-generated content.

4. **RabbitMQ**:
   - Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices.
   - Queues tasks, such as AI requests, to ensure smooth operation under high load.

## **Production-Grade PostgreSQL Setup**

### **Key Features**
- **High Availability**:
  - Implement replication with a primary-replica setup to ensure data redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Scalability**:
  - Use read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads, such as content search operations.
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Configure automated backups with a retention policy to prevent data loss.
  - Test backups periodically to ensure reliability.

### **Sharding and Partitioning**
- **Sharding**:
  - If data grows beyond manageable limits, partition databases by world or campaign.
  - Assign shards to different nodes to distribute load effectively.
- **Partitioning**:
  - Use PostgreSQL's table partitioning features for large datasets like logs or events.
  - Partition tables by time or a key (e.g., campaign ID) to optimize query performance.

### **Schema Management**
- **Version Control**:
  - Use tools like Flyway or Liquibase for schema migrations.
  - Maintain versioned SQL migration files to track changes.
- **Zero Downtime Migrations**:
  - Employ techniques like:
    - Adding new columns with default values before populating them.
    - Using feature toggles to roll out schema changes incrementally.
  - Apply schema changes to replicas before promoting them to primary.

### **Monitoring and Metrics**
- Use tools like **pg_stat_statements** to analyze slow queries.
- Monitor database health with tools like **pgAdmin** or cloud-native monitoring solutions (e.g., AWS RDS monitoring, Datadog).

## **Redis Configuration**

### **Cluster Mode**
- Enable Redis Cluster Mode for distributed caching and failover support.
- Use a minimum of three master nodes with three replicas for high availability.

### **Use Cases**
1. **Caching**:
   - Store frequently accessed static data (e.g., character profiles, traits) to reduce database load.
2. **Ephemeral State**:
   - Manage temporary states, such as ongoing dialogue trees or combat rounds.
3. **Session Management**:
   - Track user sessions and gameplay states.

### **Persistence**
- Use **RDB snapshots** or **AOF persistence** to recover from unexpected failures.
- For critical data, ensure backup configurations are enabled.

### **Monitoring**
- Use tools like **RedisInsight** to monitor performance and analyze key patterns.

## **RabbitMQ Configuration**

### **Clustering**
- Deploy RabbitMQ in a clustered setup to ensure high availability.
- Use mirrored queues to replicate messages across nodes.

### **High Availability**
- Use quorum queues to handle message durability and minimize loss during node failures.

### **Monitoring**
- Enable the RabbitMQ Management plugin for insights into queue lengths, connection status, and throughput.

---

## **Deployment Considerations**

### **Infrastructure**
- Deploy PostgreSQL and Redis in managed environments, such as AWS RDS and AWS ElastiCache, to reduce operational overhead.
- Use VPC for isolating database instances from external traffic.
- Apply IAM policies for secure access control.

### **Scaling**
- Enable auto-scaling for managed database services to handle traffic spikes.
- Monitor usage metrics and preemptively scale resources during predictable high-demand periods (e.g., campaign launches).

### **Security**
- Use encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest for sensitive data.
- Restrict database access by IP or VPC endpoint.
- Regularly rotate database credentials or use AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential storage.

## **Database Migration Process**

### **Safe Migration Workflow**
1. **Development**:
   - Test schema changes locally with sample data.
   - Validate migrations against a staging environment before production rollout.
2. **Deployment**:
   - Apply non-disruptive changes (e.g., adding columns) first.
   - Populate new columns or tables asynchronously.
   - Migrate production data in small batches to avoid downtime.
3. **Verification**:
   - Validate the integrity of migrated data.
   - Monitor application performance for issues related to schema changes.

## **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

### **Backup Strategy**
- Use automated daily snapshots for PostgreSQL and Redis.
- Retain backups for at least 30 days or as required by business needs.

### **Disaster Recovery Steps**
1. **Identify Failure**:
   - Detect database failures using monitoring alerts.
2. **Failover**:
   - Promote a read replica to primary in PostgreSQL.
   - Redirect Redis traffic to a backup node or cluster.
3. **Restore**:
   - Restore from the latest snapshot or backup.
   - Test restored data for integrity before resuming operations.

## **AWS Integration**

### **RDS for PostgreSQL**
- Simplifies scaling, backups, and failover with minimal manual intervention.
- Use Multi-AZ deployments for high availability.

### **ElastiCache for Redis**
- Manage caching with minimal operational overhead.
- Leverage built-in monitoring and failover support.

### **Networking**
- Place databases in private subnets within the VPC.
- Use security groups to restrict access to backend services.

---

## **Real-World Challenges and Solutions**

### **Handling High Traffic**
- Use Redis to offload read-heavy queries from PostgreSQL.
- Scale RabbitMQ workers to handle message bursts.

### **Maintaining Consistency**
- Ensure consistency between the World and Campaign databases with scheduled integrity checks.
- Use distributed transactions cautiously to avoid bottlenecks.

### **Monitoring Complex Queries**
- Regularly analyze query execution plans using **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**.
- Refactor slow queries with optimized indexing and partitioning.

## **Conclusion**

This database architecture balances scalability, reliability, and efficiency. By leveraging managed services like AWS RDS and ElastiCache alongside tools like Redis and RabbitMQ, the system can handle the demands of dynamic content generation and campaign simulation, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Proper planning, monitoring, and disaster recovery strategies are critical to maintaining a robust and high-performing database layer in production.
