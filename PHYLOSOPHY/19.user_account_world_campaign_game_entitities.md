# Managing Account, User, and Cross-Database Entities in the Game System

## **Overview**

This document outlines the architecture and rationale behind splitting **Account** and **User** entities, managing data across two independent databases (**World** and **Campaign**), and addressing the risks and challenges of entity duplication. The proposed design balances simplicity and functionality while acknowledging potential pitfalls such as data consistency and synchronization.

---

## **1. Splitting Account and User Entities**

### **Purpose**
The separation of the **Account** and **User** entities serves to decouple sensitive personal details (e.g., email, username) from game-specific relationships (e.g., Items, Characters).

### **Design**
- **Account**: Contains sensitive personal details such as:
  - `email`
  - `username`
  - Authentication-related data (e.g., external auth integration in the future).
  - No connections to game entities.
- **User**: Represents the player's in-game presence with:
  - Connections to **Characters**, **Items**, and other game entities.
  - Links to game-specific configurations and relationships.

### **Relationship**
- **One-to-One Relationship**:
  - Each **Account** maps to one **User**, ensuring a clear separation of personal and game data.
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    @Entity()
    class Account {
        @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
        id: number;

        @Column()
        email: string;

        @Column()
        username: string;

        @OneToOne(() => User)
        @JoinColumn()
        user: User;
    }

    @Entity()
    class User {
        @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
        id: number;

        @OneToOne(() => Account, account => account.user)
        account: Account;

        @OneToMany(() => Character, character => character.user)
        characters: Character[];

        @OneToMany(() => Item, item => item.user)
        items: Item[];
    }
    ```

## **2. Managing Two Independent Databases**

### **World Database**
- **Purpose**: Acts as the central repository for static content:
  - **Worlds**, **Items**, **Factions**, **Skills**, and other pre-defined content.
  - Contains **Campaign** entries but only as static references (no dynamic game state).

### **Campaign Database**
- **Purpose**: Represents dynamic game states:
  - Includes all entities necessary for the campaign's lifecycle (**Characters**, **Items**, **Events**, etc.).
  - Operates independently once created.

---

## **3. Entity Duplication**

### **Rationale**
To maintain the independence of **World** and **Campaign** databases, duplication of certain entities is necessary. For example:
1. **Account** and **User**: Simplifies access to player data in both contexts.
2. **World** and **Campaign**: Enables the creation of independent campaign instances from static world data.

### **Duplicated Entities**
- **Account**:
  - Only minimal data is stored in the **Campaign** database (e.g., `email` and `username`).
  - Sensitive data like passwords (even if hashed) is avoided in the **Campaign** database.
- **User**:
  - Maintained in both databases to associate Accounts with Characters or game entities.

### **Risks**
- **Consistency**: If an operation (e.g., account creation) succeeds in one database but fails in the other, discrepancies arise.
- **Complexity**: Additional logic is required to manage synchronization between the databases.

---

## **4. Risks and Mitigation**

### **Risk: Inconsistent Duplication**
Operations like creating a world or campaign require duplicating data. A failure in one database can leave the system in an inconsistent state.

#### **Mitigation**:
1. **Transactional Operations**:
   - Perform operations on both databases as a single logical unit.
   - If either operation fails, rollback changes in both databases.
2. **Background Consistency Check**:
   - Periodically verify consistency across databases.
3. **Error Logging and Recovery**:
   - Capture and log errors with detailed context for manual intervention.
4. **Use Case Prioritization**:
   - Limit duplication to essential cases (e.g., Account `email` and `username`).

---

## **5. Workflow: World and Campaign Interaction**

### **World-to-Campaign Duplication**
When creating a campaign:
1. Duplicate **World** data into the **Campaign** database.
2. The duplicated **World** data in **Campaign** is static and disconnected from the original.

#### **Example Workflow**
1. **World Database**:
   - World: *"Vvardenfell"* (static reference)
2. **Campaign Database**:
   - Campaign created from *"Vvardenfell"*, dynamically evolving with unique entities.

---

## **6. Implementation Notes**

### **Account Handling**
- **World Database**:
  - Full **Account** entity with email, username, and third-party auth integration.
- **Campaign Database**:
  - Minimal **Account** entity:
    - `email` and `username` for identification.
    - Avoid sensitive fields like hashed passwords.

### **Entity Relationships**
- Game entities (e.g., **Items**, **Characters**) are not duplicated between **World** and **Campaign** databases.
- **World** data copied into a **Campaign** is static, while campaign entities evolve independently.

---

## **Conclusion**

This architecture splits **Account** and **User** entities to maintain a clear separation of concerns. Managing two independent databases with selective duplication of entities ensures simplicity while addressing the unique requirements of both static and dynamic game data. By identifying risks and proposing mitigations, this document outlines a scalable and efficient system for managing game data across **World** and **Campaign** databases.
