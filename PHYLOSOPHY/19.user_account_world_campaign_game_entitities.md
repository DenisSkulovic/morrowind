// TODO generate a nice concept document
I decided to split the entities of Account and User, so that Account keeps things like email and other details, but no connection to game entities; and User will contain all connections to game entities like Items, Characters, etc. User and Account will have a OneToOne relationship.
Now. Regarding managing entities across 2 databases. I decided that for simplicity (but of course it will come with some risks that I need to address) I will be duplicating entity information for Account, User (but the connected game entities will be independent), World and Campaign. All game entities will be independent between the 2 databases, except from the case when World entities are copied into a Campaign to start a game. Since a Campaign is created, there is absolutely no connection or relation between 2 databases. World database creates content for Campaigns, and Campaigns when created start their own dynamic independent life from the World. The world database will still have entries for Campaign entities, these will still be duplicated, but the Campaign entity on the world db will not have anything connected to it.
The risk that I mentioned is duplicating information, and if one operation succeeds and the other fails, we are in deep trouble, and there will be a lot of operations that require duplication (creating worlds and campaigns mostly, also updating Account data (maybe I should store a limited version of Account on the Campaign db, like email and username, but nothing like hashed password (I know I know, I will end up using some 3rd party solution for auth and avoid storing the password, but hey, this is just an MVP, leave me alone, k?)))
