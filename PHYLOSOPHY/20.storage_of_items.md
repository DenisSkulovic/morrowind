# **Item, Equipment Slot, and Storage Slot System**

## **Concept Overview**
This system uses two distinct types of slots—**Equipment Slots** and **Storage Slots**—to manage items, storage, and equipment for characters and containers in a game. Each slot serves a specific purpose:
- **Equipment Slots** handle items that are actively used by a character (e.g., weapons, armor, tools).
- **Storage Slots** manage items stored in containers (e.g., backpacks, pockets, chests) with grid and weight constraints.

The design avoids a generic inventory entity. Instead, a **character has equipment slots**, and **items in equipment slots can have storage slots**. This ensures flexibility while maintaining a clear separation of active and inactive items.

---

## **Key Mechanics**

### **1. Equipment Slots**
- Equipment slots are directly tied to a character.
- Each slot holds **exactly one item**, which can be active in gameplay.
- Slots are defined by their **type** (e.g., left hand, right hand, head).
- The item in an equipment slot can have associated attributes like:
  - **Actions** (e.g., attack, block).
  - **Modifiers** (e.g., damage boost, defense).
  - **Nested storage** (e.g., a backpack adds storage slots).

### **2. Storage Slots**
- Storage slots belong to items like backpacks, jackets, or chests.
- Each storage slot:
  - Can hold **multiple items** (inactive in gameplay).
  - Has **grid dimensions** (width and height) to simulate item fitting.
  - Has a **weight limit** to restrict item capacity.
- Items in storage slots remain inactive until moved to an equipment slot.

### **3. Items**
- Items can be equipped in equipment slots or stored in storage slots.
- Items can also function as containers by having their own storage slots.

## **Entity Design**

### **1. Equipment Slot**
An `EquipmentSlot` is tied to a character and holds a single active item.

#### **Attributes**
- `character`: The owning character.
- `equippedItem`: The item currently in the slot.

#### **Code**
```typescript
@Entity()
@TableInheritance({ column: { type: "varchar", name: "type" } })
export class EquipmentSlot extends ContentBase {

    <...>

    @OneToOne(() => Item, { nullable: true })
    @JoinColumn()
    equippedItem?: Item;

    @ManyToOne(() => Character, (character) => character.equipmentSlots, { nullable: true })
    character?: Character; // The character owning this slot (i.e. left hand slot, right hand slot, head slot)

    <...>
}

```

---

### **2. Storage Slot**
A `StorageSlot` belongs to an item (e.g., a backpack or chest) and holds multiple items.

#### **Attributes**
- `grid`: Optional dimensions defining the slot's grid size.
- `maxWeight`: Restriction on the total weight of items in the slot.
- `parentItem`: The item (e.g., backpack) that owns the storage slot.
- `storedItems`: The items stored within this slot.

#### **Code**
```typescript
@Entity()
@TableInheritance({ column: { type: "varchar", name: "type" } })
export class StorageSlot extends ContentBase {

    <...>

    @Column({type: "varchar", length: 50})
    name!: string

    @Column({ nullable: true })
    grid?: { width: number; height: number }; // Grid configuration for storage slots

    @Column({ nullable: true })
    maxWeight?: number; // Weight limitation for storage slots

    @ManyToOne(() => Item, (parentItem) => parentItem.storageSlot, { nullable: true })
    parentItem?: Item; // The item owning this slot (for storage slots)

    @OneToMany(() => Item, (storedItem) => storedItem.storageSlot, { cascade: true })
    storedItems?: Item[]; // For storage slots

    <...>

}

```

---

### **3. Item**
Items are central to this system, functioning as:
1. **Active equipment** when placed in equipment slots.
2. **Containers** when they own storage slots.

#### **Attributes**
- `storageSlots`: Represents storage capabilities for items like backpacks.
- `storageSlot`: The slot where this item is stored (e.g., in a backpack section).

#### **Code**
```typescript
@Entity()
@TableInheritance({ column: { type: "varchar", name: "type" } })
export class Item extends TaggableContentBase {

    <...>

    // properties
    @Column("json", { nullable: true })
    size!: { width: number; height: number }; // Grid size for grid-based inventories
    @Column({ default: 0 })
    weight!: number;
    @Column({ default: 1 })
    quantity!: number;
    @Column({ default: 64 })
    maxQuantity!: number;

    // slots
    @ManyToOne(() => StorageSlot, storageSlot => storageSlot.parentItem)
    storageSlot?: StorageSlot; // the slot where this item is stored (in a backpack section, for e.g., for in a pocket)
    @OneToMany(() => StorageSlot, storageSlot => storageSlot.storedItems)
    storageSlots?: StorageSlot[]; // the storage slots this item itself has (this is a backpack and it has 3 sections, i.e. slots)
    @ManyToOne(() => EquipmentSlot, equipmentSlot => equipmentSlot.equippedItem)
    equipmentSlot?: EquipmentSlot; // the equipment slot where this item sits (sword in hand, for e.g.)

    <...>
}
```

---

### **4. Character**
Characters only have equipment slots. Storage capabilities are provided by the items in these slots.

#### **Code**
```typescript
@Entity()
export class Character extends TaggableContentBase {

    <...>

    @OneToMany(() => EquipmentSlot, (slot) => slot.character)
    equipmentSlots!: EquipmentSlot[]; // Equipment slots for the character

    <...>

}
```

    }

## **Gameplay Examples**

### **A. Equipping a Backpack**
1. Assign the backpack to an equipment slot (e.g., "Back").
2. The backpack provides storage slots for other items.

```typescript
const character = new Character();
character.equipmentSlots = [];

const backpack = new Item();
backpack.name = "Small Backpack";
backpack.weight = 2;

const backpackSlot = new EquipmentSlot();
backpackSlot.character = character;
backpackSlot.equippedItem = backpack;

character.equipmentSlots.push(backpackSlot);

// Save the character
await characterRepository.save(character);
```

---

### **B. Adding Items to a Backpack**
1. Check weight and grid constraints before adding an item.
2. Use the grid-based system to place the item at an available position.
3. If no valid position exists, throw an error.

```typescript
function addItemToStorageSlot(storageSlot: StorageSlot, item: Item): void {
    const totalWeight = storageSlot.storedItems?.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.weight, 0) || 0;

    // Check weight constraint
    if (totalWeight + item.weight > storageSlot.maxWeight!) {
        throw new Error("Exceeds weight limit.");
    }

    // Check for available space and place the item
    if (!autoPlaceItem(storageSlot.gridState, item)) {
        throw new Error("Not enough space in the storage slot.");
    }

    // Add the item to the storage slot's list of stored items
    storageSlot.storedItems = storageSlot.storedItems || [];
    storageSlot.storedItems.push(item);
}
```

---

### **C. Equipping a Sword**
A sword is placed in an equipment slot, activating its attributes.

```typescript
const sword = new Item();
sword.name = "Iron Sword";
sword.weight = 3;

const rightHandSlot = new EquipmentSlot();
rightHandSlot.character = character;
rightHandSlot.equippedItem = sword;

character.equipmentSlots.push(rightHandSlot);

// Save the updated character
await characterRepository.save(character);
```
