# GraphQL vs gRPC vs REST: Concepts, Vision, and Reasoning

## Introduction
This document explores the benefits of using GraphQL over gRPC and REST APIs for complex queries while retaining gRPC for CRUD operations. It examines the specific use case of building a backend for flexible search functionality and offers insights into how GraphQL elegantly solves limitations inherent in gRPC and REST.

GraphQL’s ability to dynamically define and request specific fields and perform complex joins makes it ideal for search scenarios. By contrast, gRPC’s structured contracts, while powerful, lack this flexibility, and REST can become cumbersome for such use cases.

This document also discusses implementation strategies for GraphQL in a TypeORM + NestJS backend and a React + Apollo Client frontend.

## Why GraphQL for Search

### **gRPC and Its Limitations**
- gRPC excels in scenarios where strict contracts and efficient, binary-encoded communication are required.
- Its philosophy is method-centric: clients make "function calls" to backend services, passing structured input and receiving structured output based on `.proto` files.
- **Limitations for Complex Queries**:
  - gRPC requires separate methods for each use case, which can lead to a proliferation of methods for varying query shapes.
  - gRPC is not inherently designed to handle dynamic field selection or deep joins involving nested relationships.
  - If the query involves retrieving multiple objects with custom shapes or filters (e.g., fetching `Characters` with their `Items`), gRPC becomes restrictive.

### **How GraphQL Solves This**
- **Flexible Queries**:
  - Clients define the fields they need, even for deeply nested relationships, in a single request.
  - Eliminates over-fetching and under-fetching common in REST and gRPC.
- **Dynamic Joins**:
  - GraphQL enables clients to request data across multiple relationships without backend changes.
  - Complex nested joins (e.g., `Character -> Items -> Traits`) are handled seamlessly.
- **Schema Evolution**:
  - Adding fields to the schema does not require changes to clients, provided they don’t query for those fields.

## Hybrid Approach: gRPC for CRUD, GraphQL for Search

### **gRPC for CRUD**
- CRUD operations are typically strict and repetitive, making gRPC’s structured `.proto` files ideal:
  - Strongly typed contracts enforce data integrity.
  - Efficient binary communication ensures fast data transfer.
  - Single responsibility methods (e.g., `CreateItem`, `UpdateCharacter`) align well with gRPC's design.
- **Why Not GraphQL for Mutations?**
  - Mutations often require strict validation and workflows.
  - GraphQL’s flexibility can be a downside here, as it introduces ambiguity and complexity for operations that benefit from rigid enforcement.

### **GraphQL for Search**
- Search functionality benefits from GraphQL’s flexibility:
  - Clients define exactly what data they need, even for deeply nested objects.
  - Searching across multiple entities with specific conditions is easier to model.
  - Unlike REST or gRPC, GraphQL queries avoid rigid method definitions for varying search needs.

## Backend Implementation with TypeORM and NestJS

### **Entities with Combined TypeORM and GraphQL Decorators**
Entities serve as the backbone for both the database (via TypeORM) and GraphQL schema:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, ManyToOne, OneToMany, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';
import { ObjectType, Field, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
@Entity()
export class Character {
  @Field(() => ID)
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id: string;

  @Field()
  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Field(() => [Item], { nullable: true })
  @OneToMany(() => Item, (item) => item.owner)
  items?: Item[];
}

@ObjectType()
@Entity()
export class Item {
  @Field(() => ID)
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id: string;

  @Field()
  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Field(() => Character, { nullable: true })
  @ManyToOne(() => Character, (character) => character.items)
  owner?: Character;
}
```

### **Input Validation**
GraphQL provides built-in validation by defining input types. For example:

```typescript
import { InputType, Field, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@InputType()
export class SearchContentInput {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  name: string;
}
```

### **Resolver Role**
Resolvers handle GraphQL queries and connect them to backend services. They exist alongside NestJS controllers, with resolvers managing GraphQL and controllers managing REST/gRPC:

```typescript
import { Resolver, Query, Args } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Resolver()
export class ContentResolver {
  constructor(private readonly contentService: ContentService) {}

  @Query(() => [Character])
  async searchContent(@Args('input') input: SearchContentInput[]): Promise<Character[]> {
    return this.contentService.search(input);
  }
}
```

### **Controller and Resolver Coexistence**
- Controllers handle REST/gRPC requests.
- Resolvers handle GraphQL requests.
- Both can share service logic:

```typescript
@Controller()
export class ContentController {
  constructor(private readonly contentService: ContentService) {}

  @GrpcMethod('ContentService', 'SearchContent')
  async searchContent(request: SearchContentRequest): Promise<SearchContentResponse> {
    return this.contentService.search(request.input);
  }
}
```

## Frontend Implementation with React + Apollo Client

### **Apollo Client Setup**
Configure Apollo Client globally in your Next.js application:

```typescript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### **Using `useQuery` for Dynamic Fetching**

```typescript
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_CONTENT = gql`
  query GetContent($input: [SearchContentInput!]!) {
    searchContent(input: $input) {
      id
      name
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

function ContentList({ input }) {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_CONTENT, { variables: { input } });

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.searchContent.map((content) => (
        <li key={content.id}>{content.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## GraphQL vs gRPC: Key Comparisons

| Feature                | GraphQL                       | gRPC                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Flexibility**        | High: Query exactly what you need. | Low: Fixed method contracts. |
| **Schema Sharing**     | Manual schema exploration.    | Automatic via `.proto`.       |
| **Complex Queries**    | Excellent for nested queries. | Limited.                      |
| **Data Efficiency**    | High: Avoid over/under-fetching. | High, but less flexible.      |
| **Mutations**          | Less ideal for strict workflows. | Ideal for CRUD.               |

## Conclusion
GraphQL complements gRPC by addressing its limitations in handling complex, dynamic queries. Retaining gRPC for strict, structured mutations and leveraging GraphQL for flexible search functionality creates a powerful hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds. By carefully aligning use cases with the strengths of each technology, you can build a scalable and efficient API ecosystem tailored to your project’s needs.
