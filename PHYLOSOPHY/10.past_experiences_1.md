### **Past Experiences System for Character Generation**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Past Experiences System** adds depth and complexity to characters by defining their **childhood** and **adulthood past experiences**, which influence their traits, skills, memories, and personality. These experiences are grouped into **pools**, and probabilities are linked to backgrounds, allowing for realistic and diverse character generation.

---

### **1. Structure of Past Experiences**

#### **Childhood Past Experiences**
- Represents formative years and socio-economic conditions.
- Examples:
  - **Poor Childhood**: Grew up in poverty, leading to frugality and resilience.
  - **Orphan**: Lost parents early, leading to independence or emotional detachment.
  - **Aristocratic Upbringing**: Raised in wealth, resulting in privilege or entitlement.
  - **Slave Childhood**: Born into slavery, leading to distrust and survival skills.

#### **Adulthood Past Experiences**
- Represents key life events or circumstances that shaped adulthood.
- Examples:
  - **War Veteran (Traumatized)**: Experienced war, resulting in PTSD or combat prowess.
  - **Freed Slave**: Gained freedom, fostering gratitude or bitterness.
  - **Exile**: Banished from their homeland, leading to loneliness or adaptability.
  - **Merchant’s Apprentice**: Learned trade skills, leading to cunning and resourcefulness.

### **2. Probabilities by Background**

Backgrounds influence the likelihood of certain past experiences. For example:
- **Imperial Guard**:
  - Childhood:
    - 40% Poor Childhood.
    - 30% Orphan.
    - 20% Aristocratic Upbringing.
    - 10% Slave Childhood.
  - Adulthood:
    - 50% War Veteran.
    - 30% Merchant’s Apprentice.
    - 20% Freed Slave.

- **Bandit**:
  - Childhood:
    - 50% Poor Childhood.
    - 40% Orphan.
    - 10% Slave Childhood.
  - Adulthood:
    - 60% Exile.
    - 30% War Veteran.
    - 10% Merchant’s Apprentice.

### **3. Effects of Past Experiences**

Each past experience affects:
1. **Traits**:
   - Adds personality traits or modifies existing ones.
2. **Skills**:
   - Grants skill bonuses or penalties.
3. **Memories**:
   - Adds specific memories tied to the experience.
4. **Behavior**:
   - Influences the character's choices and interactions.

---

### **4. Workflow for Past Experiences Assignment**

1. **Select Background**:
   - Begin with a background (e.g., "Imperial Guard").
2. **Assign Childhood Experience**:
   - Roll against probabilities to assign one childhood experience.
3. **Assign Adulthood Experiences**:
   - Roll against probabilities to assign 1-2 adulthood experiences.
4. **Apply Effects**:
   - Update the character’s traits, skills, and memories based on the selected experiences.

### **5. Conceptual Example**

#### Background: Imperial Guard  
#### Selected Experiences:
1. Childhood: **Poor Childhood**.
2. Adulthood: **War Veteran (Traumatized)** and **Merchant’s Apprentice**.

#### Resulting Character:
- **Traits**:
  - From **Poor Childhood**: Frugal, Resourceful.
  - From **War Veteran**: Disciplined, PTSD.
  - From **Merchant’s Apprentice**: Cunning, Persuasive.
- **Skills**:
  - From **Poor Childhood**: Survival +2.
  - From **War Veteran**: Swordsmanship +3.
  - From **Merchant’s Apprentice**: Negotiation +2.
- **Memories**:
  - From **Poor Childhood**: `"Remembers struggling to find food as a child."`
  - From **War Veteran**: `"Nightmares of comrades lost in battle."`
  - From **Merchant’s Apprentice**: `"Learned to trade goods under a shrewd master."`

### **7. Expanded Workflow for Character Generation**

1. **Step 1: Assign Background**:
   - Example: `"Imperial Guard"`.
2. **Step 2: Roll for Childhood Experience**:
   - Roll against probabilities in `"childhood_probabilities"`.
   - Result: `"Poor Childhood"`.
3. **Step 3: Roll for Adulthood Experiences**:
   - Roll twice against `"adulthood_probabilities"`.
   - Results: `"War Veteran"`, `"Merchant’s Apprentice"`.
4. **Step 4: Apply Effects**:
   - Add traits, skills, and memories from selected experiences.
5. **Step 5: Finalize Character**:
   - Combine effects into a complete character.
