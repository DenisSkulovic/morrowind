# **Concept Document: Managing Live Dynamic Campaign Data**

## **Overview**
This document outlines the approach for managing live dynamic campaign data for the game. The goal is to balance performance, reliability, and scalability by leveraging an in-memory database (Redis) for real-time interactions and a traditional relational database for long-term persistence.

---

## **Key Concepts**

### **1. In-Memory Data Management**
Redis serves as the central data layer during a live campaign session. It stores the campaign state, including active entities, dynamic NPCs, player interactions, and world events.

**Why Redis?**
- **Speed**: Redis offers low-latency operations, ideal for real-time gameplay.
- **Scalability**: Redis can handle a large volume of read/write operations, ensuring smooth gameplay.
- **Temporary Storage**: Redis efficiently handles transient data like combat states or dialogue options.

---

### **2. Persistent Database**
A PostgreSQL database acts as the long-term storage for all campaign-related data. It is used to:
- Fetch initial campaign data when starting a session.
- Periodically save the live campaign state.
- Store critical game state snapshots during autosaves or manual saves.

---

## **Workflow: Interactions Between Redis and PostgreSQL**

### **A. Starting a Campaign**
1. **Data Load**:
   - The necessary campaign data (e.g., player characters, essential NPCs, world state) is fetched from PostgreSQL and loaded into Redis.
   - Only active or nearby entities are loaded to minimize memory usage.

2. **Redis Initialization**:
   - Data is structured into Redis, e.g.,:
     - Player inventory.
     - Current world events.
     - Active NPCs in the player's vicinity.

---

### **B. During Gameplay**
All real-time interactions occur within Redis to ensure high performance.

1. **Data Reads**:
   - Game components (inventory, combat systems, NPC interactions) read data from Redis for immediate use.

2. **Data Writes**:
   - Changes to the campaign state (e.g., moving an item, defeating an NPC, altering world state) are written to Redis in real-time.

3. **Transient Data**:
   - Temporary states (e.g., ongoing combat, dialogue choices) are maintained in Redis only and do not persist to the database unless explicitly required.

---

### **C. Autosaving**
At regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes), a background task:
1. **Serializes Redis Data**:
   - Gathers the current state of all relevant entities from Redis.
2. **Writes to PostgreSQL**:
   - Updates only the modified entities in the database to ensure efficiency.

**Fallback**: Redis snapshots can also be configured to create persistent backups, reducing the risk of data loss.

---

### **D. Manual Save**
When the player manually saves the campaign:
1. **Immediate Sync**:
   - Redis data is fully serialized and written to PostgreSQL.
   - Ensures that all progress is stored reliably.

---

### **E. Ending a Campaign Session**
1. **Final Sync**:
   - Upon exiting the game, Redis data is flushed to PostgreSQL to capture the final state of the campaign.
2. **Redis Cleanup**:
   - The Redis instance is cleared to free up resources.

---

## **Data Management Considerations**

### **1. Selective Loading**
- **What to Load**:
  - Only the data relevant to the current player's location and interactions.
  - E.g., If the player is in a town, load town NPCs, nearby quests, and local events.
- **What to Leave in the Database**:
  - Far-off locations, unused NPCs, and dormant quests remain in PostgreSQL.

### **2. Selective Persistence**
- **When to Save**:
  - Autosave intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
  - Major events (e.g., completing a quest, significant player actions).
  - Manual save triggers.
- **What to Save**:
  - Persistent entities: Player characters, NPCs, quest states, inventory.
  - Non-persistent data like temporary combat states is discarded.

---

## **Handling Risks**

### **1. Redis Failure**
- Configure Redis to create frequent snapshots (RDB files) or enable append-only files (AOF) for durability.
- Upon failure, the last snapshot is used to restore the session, minimizing progress loss.

### **2. Data Sync Errors**
- Use a transaction-based approach when syncing data from Redis to PostgreSQL to ensure atomicity.
- Maintain a logging system to track unsynced or partially synced data for troubleshooting.

### **3. Data Consistency**
- Perform validation when reading from or writing to Redis to ensure data integrity (e.g., valid references to entities).

---

## **Advanced Functionalities (Future Enhancements)**

### **1. Incremental Data Loading**
- Dynamically load and unload entities into Redis based on the playerâ€™s movement and interactions.
- E.g., Entering a new town loads town-specific data, while data from the previous area is offloaded.

### **2. Campaign Snapshots**
- Allow the player to create "save files" that capture the full campaign state for restoration or export.

### **3. Import/Export Worlds**
- Support zipping a world or campaign state into a file for sharing or archiving.
- Provide import functionality to load shared worlds or campaigns.

## **Conclusion**
This approach combines Redis for real-time, high-performance gameplay with PostgreSQL for robust, long-term persistence. By leveraging the strengths of both systems, the game ensures smooth, dynamic gameplay while maintaining data reliability and scalability for the future.
