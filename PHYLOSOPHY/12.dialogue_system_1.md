### **Dialogue System Concept**

---

#### **Overview**

The Dialogue System aims to simulate realistic conversations between two NPCs or between the player and an NPC. Conversations are influenced by:
1. **Goals and Interests**: The underlying purpose of the dialogue for both participants.
2. **Personality Traits**: Affect conversational tone and behavior.
3. **Mood and State**: Temporary conditions (e.g., bad mood, pain, drunkenness) modify willingness and style.
4. **Dynamic Progression**: Conversations evolve naturally, shifting between topics, ending abruptly, or drawing to a conclusion.

This system balances realism and gameplay by making dialogues dynamic, goal-oriented, and context-sensitive.

### **1. Dialogue Components**

#### **1.1 Goals**
Goals define what each participant wants to achieve from the conversation. Goals can align, conflict, or be unrelated.

**Examples**:
- **Recreate**: Casual, enjoyable conversation to pass the time or bond.
- **Gather Information**: Learn about topics like local rumors, directions, or prices.
- **Resolve Conflict**: Negotiate with a bandit or bribe a guard.
- **Trade**: Engage in buying and selling.
- **Seek Help**: Request assistance or guidance.
- **Deceive**: Mislead or manipulate the other participant.

#### **1.2 Interests**
Interests are areas of curiosity or topics a participant finds engaging. These are tied to traits, background, and context.

**Examples**:
- Religion (Pilgrim).
- Trade and profit (Merchant).
- Local rumors and news (Commoner).
- Adventure and danger (Bandit).

#### **1.3 Personality Traits**
Traits (e.g., introverted, aggressive, curious) influence:
1. **Openness to Conversation**: Willingness to engage.
2. **Tone and Style**: Formal, casual, hostile, etc.
3. **Topic Selection**: Preference for certain topics.

#### **1.4 Mood and State**
Temporary modifiers affect dialogue behavior:
- **Mood**: Angry, happy, anxious, irritated, etc.
- **State**: Injured, drunk, tired, busy, etc.

**Examples**:
- A drunk bandit may talk more openly but irrationally.
- An injured guard may refuse to converse.

### **2. Dialogue Progression**

#### **2.1 Starting a Dialogue**
1. **Initial Context**: Conversation begins with a purpose (explicit or implied). 
    - Example: The player approaches a merchant and opens with, “What do you have for sale?”
2. **Openness Check**: NPC willingness to engage based on attitude, mood, and personality.
    - Example: A friendly NPC with a high attitude toward the player is more likely to engage.

#### **2.2 Maintaining the Dialogue**
1. **Topic Selection**:
    - Participants select topics based on **goals**, **interests**, and **context**.
    - Example: A pilgrim steers the conversation toward religious landmarks.
2. **Goal Alignment**:
    - Aligned goals lead to smooth progression.
    - Conflicting or unrelated goals cause friction or disinterest.
    - Example: A bandit focused on robbery has little patience for casual small talk.

#### **2.3 Ending the Dialogue**
Conversations end in various ways:
1. **Natural Conclusion**:
    - Goals are achieved (e.g., trade completed, conflict resolved).
    - Participants lose interest or reach a mutual stopping point.
2. **Abrupt Ending**:
    - External factors (e.g., interruption, combat).
    - One participant becomes disinterested or irritated.
3. **Forced Termination**:
    - Participant ends the conversation outright (e.g., “Leave me alone!”).

### **3. System Mechanics**

#### **3.1 Dialogue Goals Table**
Defines common goals and their mechanics.

| **Goal**           | **Description**                                   | **Example Mechanics**                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Recreate**        | Casual, enjoyable conversation.                   | Builds relationship, triggers stories or rumors.    |
| **Gather Info**     | Learn about topics like rumors, directions, etc.  | Unlocks quest info, maps, or secrets.              |
| **Resolve Conflict**| Negotiate, bribe, or diffuse a situation.         | Changes attitude, prevents combat.                 |
| **Trade**           | Buy and sell goods.                               | Opens inventory UI.                                |
| **Seek Help**       | Request guidance or assistance.                   | NPC offers help or advice.                         |
| **Deceive**         | Mislead or manipulate the NPC.                    | Can succeed or fail based on skills and traits.     |

#### **3.2 Dialogue State Machine**
A finite state machine manages dialogue flow:
1. **Start State**: Initial opening lines.
2. **Goal State**: Drives the conversation topic.
3. **Transition States**: Move between topics or change tone based on alignment or disinterest.
4. **End State**: Concludes the dialogue.

### **4. Attitude and Dialogue Influence**

**Attitude Range**:
- **High Attitude**: Friendly, engaging, cooperative tone.
- **Low Attitude**: Hostile, dismissive, or uncooperative tone.

| **Attitude Level**  | **Dialogue Behavior**                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| > 75                | NPC is eager to converse, shares information freely. |
| 50-75               | Neutral tone, willing to engage in standard topics.  |
| 25-50               | Guarded tone, limited engagement, avoids certain topics. |
| < 25                | Hostile or dismissive, may refuse to talk.  |

### **5. Topics and Interests**

#### **Topic Matching**
Topics align with **interests** of both participants. NPCs favor topics that match their **personality** and **background**.

**Examples**:
- A pilgrim prefers topics about religion and holy sites.
- A merchant prefers topics about trade and rumors.

#### **Interest Fatigue**
Repetition of the same topic reduces engagement. For example:
- A merchant becomes bored if repeatedly asked about prices.
- A pilgrim may lose interest in discussing religion after a long conversation.
