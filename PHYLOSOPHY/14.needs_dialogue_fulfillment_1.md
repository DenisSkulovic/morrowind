### **Needs System for Dynamic NPC Behavior**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Needs System** provides a framework for managing NPC behavior based on their personal requirements and desires. Needs influence **mood**, **dialogue dynamics**, and **behavior**. Each NPC has a set of **core needs**, modified by **personality traits**, **roles**, and **circumstances**. When needs are unmet, they affect the NPC’s mood and trigger goal-oriented behaviors to satisfy those needs.

This system bridges gameplay and immersion, allowing NPCs to act autonomously, engage in meaningful dialogue, and contribute to a living, dynamic world.

### **1. Core Needs**

Core needs are universal but vary in **importance** and **thresholds** based on traits, roles, and personalities.

### **2. Personality-Driven Modifiers**

NPC traits, roles, and personalities modify their needs. These modifiers affect:
1. **Thresholds**: How low a need can drop before it impacts mood and behavior.
2. **Fulfillment Requirements**: How much effort is required to satisfy the need.

| **Trait**       | **Modified Need**             | **Effect**                                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gluttonous**  | Hunger                        | Faster hunger decay, higher threshold for satisfaction.                                       |
| **Curious**     | Knowledge                     | Increased thirst for knowledge.                                                              |
| **Reserved**    | Entertainment                 | Reduced need for recreation or socializing.                                                  |
| **Drunkard**    | Addictions (Alcohol)          | Constant need for alcohol; impacts mood if unmet.                                             |
| **Religious**   | Religious Fulfillment         | Higher priority for spiritual activities.                                                    |
| **Greedy**      | Financial Stability           | Higher need for coin accumulation and profitable opportunities.                              |
| **Cowardly**    | Security                      | Higher sensitivity to perceived threats, prioritizes fleeing.                                |
| **Brave**       | Security                      | Lower sensitivity to danger, focuses on confronting threats.                                 |

### **3. Needs Decay and Fulfillment**

#### **Decay Mechanics**
- Needs decay naturally over time at different rates based on **traits**, **activities**, and **environment**.
  - Example: Hunger decays faster during physical labor, slower when resting.
- Extreme environments accelerate decay:
  - Thirst decays faster in a desert or while traveling.
  - Comfort decays in cold or dirty settings.
- Security decays in response to perceived or actual threats (e.g., a bandit nearby, active combat).

#### **Fulfillment Mechanics**
- NPCs prioritize unmet needs and perform actions to address them:
  - A **hungry NPC** may stop their current activity to eat.
  - A **bored NPC** may seek chitchat or entertainment at a tavern.
  - An NPC with low security may avoid danger or flee.

#### **Thresholds**
- Needs have thresholds that trigger **mood effects** and **behavioral shifts**:
  - **Low Hunger**: NPC becomes irritable.
  - **Low Comfort**: NPC becomes less productive and seeks rest.
  - **Low Security**: NPC becomes anxious or focuses on survival.

---

### **4. Need Fulfillment Impact on Dialogue**

Needs dynamically influence dialogue tone, willingness to engage, and conversational goals:
1. **Mood Effects**:
   - Needs impact mood, which in turn affects dialogue behavior.
   - Example:
     - Hungry NPC: “I don’t have time to talk right now; I need to eat.”
     - Bored NPC: “Got a story to tell? I could use some entertainment.”
     - Anxious NPC: “Can we talk later? I don’t feel safe here.”

2. **Goal Adjustment**:
   - Conversations may shift based on active needs.
   - Example:
     - A merchant with low financial stability may push harder for a sale: “This deal could save my business!”
     - A scared villager may urgently seek help: “There are wolves nearby. Please protect us!”

3. **Personality Filtering**:
   - Personality traits modify how needs manifest in dialogue.
   - Example:
     - A gluttonous NPC might humorously complain: “I’m starving! When’s the next meal?”
     - A paranoid NPC with low security might refuse to talk altogether: “Not now. I think someone’s watching me.”

---

### **5. Behavior Triggered by Needs**

When needs fall below critical thresholds, NPCs take specific actions:
1. **Hunger**:
   - Buy, beg, or steal food.
   - Complain about hunger during conversations.
2. **Thirst**:
   - Seek water or alcohol at a tavern or nearby source.
3. **Comfort**:
   - Find a place to rest, avoid dangerous or uncomfortable locations.
4. **Entertainment**:
   - Initiate chitchat, join games, or attend recreational events.
5. **Knowledge**:
   - Visit libraries, question travelers, or explore ruins.
6. **Financial Stability**:
   - Seek work, trade, beg, or steal.
7. **Religious Fulfillment**:
   - Pray, visit shrines, or discuss religion with others.
8. **Addictions**:
   - Focus on fulfilling the addiction at all costs, impacting other needs.
9. **Security**:
   - Avoid danger, seek safe environments, or engage in defensive actions.

### **6. Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Hungry Merchant**
- **Need**: Hunger (Critical).
- **Behavior**: Merchant interrupts trade to eat a meal.
- **Dialogue**:
  - “I’ll get back to you after I’ve had my meal. Can’t think straight on an empty stomach!”

#### **Scenario 2: Curious Scholar**
- **Need**: Knowledge (Low).
- **Behavior**: The scholar seeks conversation with a pilgrim to learn about holy sites.
- **Dialogue**:
  - “You mentioned the shrine of Vivec. What did you learn there?”

#### **Scenario 3: Anxious Villager**
- **Need**: Security (Critical).
- **Behavior**: The villager nervously avoids conversation and seeks protection.
- **Dialogue**:
  - “There are wolves nearby. Please, can you help us?”

#### **Scenario 4: Bored Fisherman**
- **Need**: Entertainment (Low).
- **Behavior**: The fisherman initiates casual conversation with a passerby.
- **Dialogue**:
  - “The fish aren’t biting today. Got any stories to pass the time?”

### **7. Integration with Other Systems**

#### **Mood and Attitude**
- Unmet needs negatively impact mood, reducing willingness to engage in dialogue and actions.
- Fulfilled needs improve mood, leading to positive interactions and increased productivity.

#### **Dialogue and Goals**
- Needs directly influence conversational goals.
  - Example: A hungry NPC shifts a general conversation toward asking for food.

#### **Memory System**
- Needs influence what NPCs remember about interactions.
  - Example: A conversation that satisfies a need (e.g., providing food) creates a positive memory, improving attitude.

#### **Autonomous Behavior**
- NPCs evaluate and adapt their actions dynamically based on needs:
  - Example: A scared villager seeks a guard, while a brave farmer defends their home.

### **8. Advantages of the Needs System**

1. **Realistic NPC Behavior**:
   - Needs-driven actions make NPCs feel alive and autonomous.
2. **Dynamic Dialogue**:
   - Conversations are context-sensitive and influenced by active needs.
3. **Immersive Worldbuilding**:
   - NPCs pursue their own goals, creating a dynamic and believable environment.
4. **Scalable Design**:
   - Easily expand needs or add unique traits for specialized characters.
5. **Emergent Gameplay**:
   - Players can influence NPC behavior by helping fulfill their needs (e.g., feeding a hungry NPC or ensuring security).
