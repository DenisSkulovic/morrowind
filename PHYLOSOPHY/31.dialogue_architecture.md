# Dialogue System Architecture Concept

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the dialogue system, emphasizing scalability, modularity, and flexibility. The architecture leverages an **event-driven design** with a **message broker** to decouple components, ensure asynchronous processing, and handle dynamic dialogue flows efficiently.

---

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Description**: Dialogue interactions generate events (e.g., `DialogueStarted`, `MessageSent`, `DialogueEnded`) that are processed asynchronously by specific services.
- **Advantages**:
  - Decouples components for modularity.
  - Improves scalability by distributing workloads.
  - Enables easy extension of features (e.g., analytics, logging).

### 2. **Message Broker**
- **Purpose**: Manages communication between services.
- **Tool**: RabbitMQ
- **Message Topics**:
  - `dialogue.initiate`
  - `dialogue.progress`
  - `dialogue.resolve`
  - `analytics.logging`

### 3. **Microservices-Based Design**
- Break the system into two core services:
  - **AI Service**:
    - Encapsulates all AI-related functionality, including:
      - Generating dialogue responses.
      - Handling other AI-driven features unrelated to dialogue.
    - Provides a generic interface for interacting with the AI provider of choice.
  - **Dialogue Service**:
    - Handles dialogue-specific logic and state management.
    - Interacts with the AI Service for response generation.

### 4. **Scalable Deployment**
- The architecture will use **Kubernetes** for production deployments, consistent with the existing backend infrastructure.
- During development, **Docker Compose** will be used for ease of setup and local testing.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. AI Service
- **Purpose**:
  - Acts as a central gateway for all AI-related operations.
  - Decouples the dialogue system from the specifics of any AI provider.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Accept requests for AI-driven tasks (e.g., dialogue response generation, other AI goals).
  - Interact with the AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, custom models).
  - Return structured responses to the requesting service.
- **Interface**:
  - Exposes generic APIs for submitting tasks and receiving results.
- **Scaling**:
  - Designed to scale horizontally to handle concurrent AI requests efficiently.

### 2. Dialogue Service
- **Purpose**:
  - Handles all dialogue-specific logic and state management.
  - Relies on the AI Service for generating responses.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage dialogue state transitions.
  - Validate player inputs (e.g., ensure goals and strategies are valid for the character).
  - Interact with the AI Service to generate response options.
  - Publish events to the message broker (e.g., `dialogue.initiate`, `dialogue.progress`).
  - Stream responses back to the frontend.
- **State Management**:
  - Maintains dialogue state in memory or via a database.
  - Tracks participant moods, opinions, and traits.

## Event Flow

### 1. Dialogue Initialization
1. Player initiates dialogue via the frontend.
2. `StartDialogueRequest` is sent to the **Dialogue Service**.
3. Dialogue Service:
   - Validates the request.
   - Publishes a `dialogue.initiate` event to RabbitMQ.
4. Dialogue Service requests response options from the **AI Service**.
5. AI Service processes the request and returns suggested responses.
6. Dialogue Service sends the response options back to the frontend.

### 2. Dialogue Progression
1. Player selects a response or configures a manual response.
2. `SendMessageRequest` is sent to the Dialogue Service.
3. Dialogue Service:
   - Updates the dialogue state in Redis.
   - Publishes a `dialogue.progress` event to RabbitMQ.
4. Dialogue Service requests a counterpart response from the AI Service.
5. Response chunks are streamed back to the frontend.

### 3. Dialogue Resolution
1. Player ends the dialogue, triggering an `EndDialogueRequest`.
2. Dialogue Service:
   - Finalizes the dialogue state, creates an outcome object to be published with the event, and removes state from Redis.
   - Publishes a `dialogue.resolve` event.
3. Relevant events are processed (e.g., logging, analytics).
4. Dialogue Service sends the summary back to the frontend.

## Suggested Deployment Model

### 1. Service Deployment
- **AI Service**:
  - Deploy multiple instances for horizontal scaling.
- **Dialogue Service**:
  - Deploy as a singleton or small cluster for state consistency.
- **Message Broker**:
  - RabbitMQ with replication for reliability.
- **Local Development**:
  - Use Docker Compose to run services locally with minimal setup.

### 2. Kubernetes Integration
- **Production**:
  - Kubernetes will handle scaling, failover, and service orchestration.
- **Development**:
  - Continue using Docker Compose for local testing and iteration.
