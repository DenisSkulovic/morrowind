I mean, yes I created some dummy services here, but my real plan is to have external services (for dialogue, for combat management, etc.) that would call this service to make modifications in the data. The load on this service must be purely related to data CRUD. I need a separate orchestrator service that would manage the Campaign, and it would call this one, the Dialogue Service, the Combat Service, etc.
