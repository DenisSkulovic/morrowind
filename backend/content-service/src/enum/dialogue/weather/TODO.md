I temporarily have these things as enums, but ultimately these must be entities, so that the user could add their own values. Ones that are unique to the world they create. Like the unique weather conditions on Vvardenfell: the ash storms, etc.

Initially I intend to use this for dialogue, to set the surrounding conditions. But ultimately this will be decided by the conditions of the location in the player campaign, in the actual game the user is playing and where their character is now located
